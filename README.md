# C Refresher for CMSC 125

This document discusses some topics in C programming and data structures that you will 
need for CMSC 125. We assume that you know the basics of C and you know how to build 
C programs using GCC in a linux environment.

## Hexadecimal Notation

Hexadecimal notation isd used in presenting memory addresses and binary data. 
It uses the following symbols (16 in total) to represent 
a number: `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F` . To indicate that a number is in hexadecimal it is usuall prepended with `0x`. For example: `0x00001000` is a 32-bit number equivalent to `4096` in 
decimal and `0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0000 0000 0000` in binary.
